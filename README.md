# background-generator

This is a small simple background generator developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that uses two inputs to create a colour gradient background which users can take the css from and use in their own projects.

Shows background being changed by editing the two colour pickers. Also gives the user the CSS code for the background so users can add it to their own projects.
